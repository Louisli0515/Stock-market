Mainly focusing on Elliott's Wave Theory to help determining the market trend

## Introduction
Elliott Wave Theory is a technical analysis used to describe price movements in the financial market. The stock price movements and consumer behaviors can be identified as waves according to Elliot.

## Basic formation

As shown in the above graph, a whole big wave consists of 8 small waves. There are two types of waves, one called **Impulse (Motive) wave** and the other called **Corrective wave**. In the above graph, wave 1,3 and 5 are **Impulse waves**, and wave 2 and 4 are **Corrective waves**. However we can see that the 5-wave trends are then corrected and reversed by 3-wave countertrends: A-B-C. 

The **Impulse wave** is not always in the upward direction and the **Corrective wave** is not always in the downward direction. That's because the definition of Impulse wave is to make a net movement in the same direction as the trend of the next-largest degree while the definition of Corrective wave is to correct the direction of the movement. For example, in the bear market shown in the following graph,

wave 1,3, and 5 are still **Impulse waves**, but they are moving downwards.

## Basic principle

* The movement of Wave 2 will not exceed the starting point of wave 1.
* Wave 3 cannot be the shortest wave.
* Wave 4 will never enter the domain of Wave 1.

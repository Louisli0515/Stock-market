As shown in the above graph, a whole big wave consists of 8 small waves. There are two types of waves, one called **Impulse (Motive) wave** and the other called **Corrective wave**. In the above graph, wave 1,3 and 5 are **Impulse waves**, and wave 2 and 4 are **Corrective waves**. However we can see that the 5-wave trends are then corrected and reversed by 3-wave countertrends: A-B-C.
